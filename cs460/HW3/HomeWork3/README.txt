What Works:
All operators, sort, redue,float fraction, isValid for divide by zero. Basically everything excpt
for overflow for IsValid

What doesn't work:
Overflow for IsValid isnt working

Note: I am using 'int' for all i.e Numerator, Denominator, and Whole. For my constructors as well. Since
Dr. Watts said it was okay to do so during class.
