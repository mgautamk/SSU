What works: 
* Identifiers, Numeric Literals, and all symbols that were given in handout. 

What doesn't work: 
* I believe everything works with all the test cases I've tested with! 

Note: Please use c++ 11 for compiling if not using the makefile I submitted. The makefile I submitted uses c++ 11. 
C++ 11 is needed because I am using string.pop_back() feature that only c++ 11 and up support!
