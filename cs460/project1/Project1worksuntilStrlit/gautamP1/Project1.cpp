//Assignment: Project 1 aka Lexical Analyzer
//Description: This program reads in a source file (.in or .py) and produces a listing file (.lst) and
//a debugging (.dbg) file. The listing file contains the lines of input file with line numbers and errors.
//The debugging file contains the lines of input file with line numbers, errors, and following each line,
//a list of the lexemes found on the line and their corresponding tokens. This analyzer recognizes lexemes 
//for identifiers, numeric literals and symbols that were given in a hand-out.
